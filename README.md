kbd - Keyboard input driver for the XLibre X server
---------------------------------------------------

This keyboard driver is primarily used with BSD, GNU Hurd, illumos, & Solaris
systems.  Linux systems should instead use either xf86-input-libinput or
xf86-input-evdev.

The primary development code repository can be found at:
